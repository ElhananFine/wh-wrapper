## Message Handlers

The `Client` class provides three event handlers to handle different types of incoming events from the WhatsApp Cloud API. These event handlers can be registered using the `on` method.

#### `messages`

The `messages` event handler is called when a new message is received from a user. This includes text messages, media messages, orders, locations, and other types of messages.

**Usage:**

```javascript
wh.on('messages', (message) => {
  console.log(`Received message from ${message.sender}: ${message.text}`);
});
```

#### `callbacks`

The `callbacks` event handler is called when a user interacts with an interactive message, such as pressing a button or selecting an option from a section list.

**Usage:**

```javascript
wh.on('callbacks', (callback) => {
  console.log(`Received callback from ${callback.sender}: ${callback.data.id}`);
});
```

#### `statuses`

The `statuses` event handler is called when a message status update is received, such as when a message is delivered, seen, or deleted.

**Usage:**

```javascript
wh.on('statuses', (status) => {
  console.log(`Message ${status.id} is now ${status.status}`);
});
```

#### `ChatOpened`

The `ChatOpened` event handler is called when a user opens a new chat with the bot. This includes cases where the user deletes the previous chat and opens a new one.

**Usage:**

```javascript
wh.on('ChatOpened', async (chat) => {
  console.log(chat);
});
```

#### `Template Status`

The `Template Status` event handler is not yet documented, and it does not have the common methods available in the other event handlers.

#### Common Methods

All event handlers (`messages`, `callbacks`, and `statuses`) have the following common methods available:

The documentation for each method can be found in the [Client documentation](/docs/client), as the methods available on the event handlers are identical to the corresponding methods on the `Client` class, with the exception that the `to` parameter does not need to be provided, as it is derived from `this.sender`.
