## Features [#features]


## Quick Start [#quick-start]

To start using the wh-wrapper library, you need to initialize a new WhatsApp client instance.

```js
import Client from "wh-wrapper";

const wh = new Client(phoneID, token);
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If you don't have a `phoneID` or `token`, or if you haven't set up an account with the Cloud API yet, [please refer to our Quick Start guide to see all the necessary steps.](/docs/Guides/getting-started)
</Callout>

If you want to receive incoming messages via the WhatsApp webhook, you can initialize the client with a verifyToken parameter.

```js
import Client from "wh-wrapper";

const wh = new Client(phoneID, token, verifyToken);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If you haven't set up a webhook or are unfamiliar with webhooks, [check out our comprehensive Webhook Setup guide for more information.](/docs/Guides/webhook)
</Callout>

After initializing the client, you can listen for incoming messages by attaching an event listener to the messages event.

```js
wh.on("messages", async (message) =>  console.log(message));
```

You can also listen for message status updates (sent, delivered, read, etc.) by attaching an event listener to the statuses event.

```js
wh.on("statuses", async (status) => console.log(status));
```

Additionally, you can listen for interactive message callbacks (button presses, section list selections) by attaching an event listener to the `callbacks` event.

```js
wh.on("callbacks", async (callback) => console.log(callback));
```

You can also listen for when a user opens a new chat with the bot by attaching an event listener to the ChatOpened event.
```js
wh.on("ChatOpened", async (chat) => console.log(chat));
```
