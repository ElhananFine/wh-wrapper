## Callback Event

The `Callback` event is emitted when a user interacts with an interactive message, such as pressing a button or selecting an option from a list.

**Listening for the `Callback` event:**

```javascript
wh.on("callbacks", async (callback: Callback) => {
  console.log(callback);
});
```

**The `Callback` class:**

- `id` (string): The ID of the incoming message. Useful for marking the message as read or for creating a thread.
- `metadata` (object):
  - `displayPhoneNumber` (string): The phone number to which the message was sent.
  - `phoneNumberID` (string): The ID of the phone number to which the message was sent.
- `fromUser` (object):
  - `whid` (string): The WhatsApp ID of the user (the phone number with the country code).
  - `name` (string): The name of the sender.
- `timestamp` (string): The time of the update.
- `type` (string): Always `interactive`.
- `clickType` (string): Either `listReply` or `buttonReply`, depending on whether the user selected an option from a list or pressed a button.
- `data` (object): The information entered by the user, with the following properties:
  - `title` (string): The title defined when sending the button or list.
  - `id` (string): The ID defined when sending the list.
  - `description` (string, optional): If the update type is `listReply`, this will be present only if a description was provided when sending the list.

**Methods:**

- `markMessageAsRead()`: Marks the message as read and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. This method does not take any parameters.
