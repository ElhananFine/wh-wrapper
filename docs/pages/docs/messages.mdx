## Incoming Messages Event

The `messages` event is emitted when a new message is received from a user. This includes text messages, media messages, reactions, locations, and other types of messages.

**Listening for the `messages` event:**

```javascript
wh.on("messages", async (message: Message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

**The `Message` class:**

- `id` (string): The ID of the message (useful for replying to the message, creating threads, and marking as read).
- `metadata` (object):
  - `displayPhoneNumber` (string): The phone number to which the message was sent.
  - `phoneNumberID` (string): The ID of the phone number to which the message was sent.
- `type` (string): The type of the message, which can be one of the following (in lowercase): `text`, `image`, `video`, `document`, `audio`, `sticker`, `reaction`, `location`, `contacts`, `unsupported`. Additionally, there will be a property with the same name as the type that will contain the actual content, If the message type is `unsupported`, there will be an property named `errors` .
- `fromUser` (object):
  - `WhID` (string): The WhatsApp ID of the user (the phone number with the country code).
  - `name` (string): The name of the sender.
- `timestamp` (Date): The time of the message.
- `hasMedia` (boolean): Whether the message contains media (`image`, `video`, `sticker`, `document`, or `audio`).
- `isReply` (boolean): Whether the message is a reply. If `true`, the `context` property will be present.
- `context` (object, optional): An object with `messageID` - The ID of the message that was replied to, and `messageFrom` (string) â€“ The number of the user who sent the message that was replied to. This will be present only if the incoming message is a reply to another message.
- `forwarded` (boolean): Whether the message was forwarded.
- `forwardedManyTimes` (boolean): Whether the message was forwarded many times. This will only appear if `forwarded` is `true`.
- `text` (string): The text of the message (if the message type is `type.text`).
- `image` (object): The image of the message (if the message type is `type.image`), with properties: `sha256`, `id`, `caption` (optional), `mimeType`.

- `sticker` (object): The sticker of the message (if the message type is `type.sticker`), with the same properties as `image`, but instead of `caption`, it has `animated` (boolean) indicating whether the sticker is animated.

### **Methods**
#### `downloadMedia()`

Downloads the media of the message, if `hasMedia` is `true`.

**Syntax:**

```js
message.downloadMedia(
  saveToFile?: boolean,
  fileName?: string,
  folderPath?: string
): Promise<{ mimeType: string; fileSize: string; filePath: string } | { mimeType: string; fileSize: string; fileBuffer: Buffer }>
```

**Parameters:**

- `saveToFile` (`boolean`, optional, default: `false`): Whether to save the media to a file on disk.
- `fileName` (`string`, optional): The name of the file to save the media as. Required if `saveToFile` is `true`.
- `folderPath` (`string`, optional): The path to the folder where the media should be saved. Required if `saveToFile` is `true`, otherwise, the default is the `files` folder in the project directory.

**Returns:**

A `Promise` that resolves with an object containing the following properties:

If `saveToFile` is `true`:
- `mimeType` (`string`): The MIME type of the media.
- `fileSize` (`string`): The size of the media file.
- `filePath` (`string`): The path to the saved media file.

If `saveToFile` is `false`:
- `mimeType` (`string`): The MIME type of the media.
- `fileSize` (`string`): The size of the media file.
- `fileBuffer` (`Buffer`): A buffer containing the media data.

**Examples:**

Saving the media to a file:

```js
const mediaInfo = await message.downloadMedia(true, 'image.jpg', '/path/to/folder');
console.log(mediaInfo.filePath); // Output: /path/to/folder/image.jpg
```

Getting the media as a buffer:

```js
const mediaInfo = await message.downloadMedia();
const fileBuffer = mediaInfo.fileBuffer;
// Do something with the file buffer
```

#### `markMessageAsRead()`

Marks the message as read. This method does not take any parameters.

**Returns:**

A `Promise` that resolves with a `boolean` indicating whether the message was successfully marked as read.

**Example:**

```js
const markAsReadSuccess = await message.markMessageAsRead("wamid.XXX="); // boolean
```
